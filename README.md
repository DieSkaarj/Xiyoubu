# Xiyoubu - Mega Drive Does What Genesis-done.

Xiyoubu is a hardware console mod for the Mega Drive/Genesis that targets ****MH-ATtiny88**** boards. It allows to change between 50Hz and 60Hz for video output (through scart) and enables language options for compatible software on the board. It also details a method for decreasing the power intake of the now retro unit by way of a USB-C power port.

***Xiyoubu has only been tested and confirmed working on a PAL Mega Drive II.***
