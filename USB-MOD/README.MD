Remember to adjust for printer tolerances. I used .01 for both ABS and PLA with the front and .005 on the back. Also note that, unless you are lighter than a photon in a star, it is advised to use glue to hold this in.

***Scale the nut to be slightly larger.***

Also, cut the bridge at the end of the bolt to accommodate a board, this is to act as a clip.

I added .008 on the bolt-socket, and .2 on the nut and had good results.
