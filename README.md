# Xiyoubu - Mega Drive Does What Genesis-done.

Xiyoubu is a hardware console mod for the Mega Drive/Genesis that targets ****MH-ATtiny88**** boards. It lets the Mega Drive change between 50Hz and 60Hz for video output (through scart) and enables language options for compatible software on the board. It also details a method for decreasing the power intake of the unit by way of a USB-C power port.

Xiyoubu will load the last saved profile on console power on.

***Xiyoubu has only been tested and confirmed working on a PAL Mega Drive II.***
