# Xiyoubu - Mega Drive Does What Genesis-done.

Xiyoubu is a hardware console mod for the Mega Drive/Genesis that targets the MH-ATtiny88 boards. It allows to change between 50 and 60Hz video frequencies and enables language options on the board. It also details a method for decreasing the power intake of the now retro unit by way of a USB-C power port.
